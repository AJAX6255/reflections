When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you are working with a team on concurrent code development, the remote
    repository would be more accessable to other team members than useing your
    local machine as a shared server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pulling changes from the remote repository 'forces' the party responsible
    for the project repository to be aware of on going version control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used to duplicate a repository within GitHub. Clone is used to duplicate a
    repository from GitHub onto a local machine. Branches are variants on a local machine
    for an intended variant of code from a 'main' branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    One can always rely on a 'fresh' version controlled code (especially if one is not
    confident in the 'cloud' storage).
