What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Assuming you are not cloning a preexisting repository, you need to start with 
	a foundation like this for a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	I get the impression that the staging area provides an area to create changes or possibly share the file for collaborative work prior to the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Make sure you perform a commit on a logical stopping point. In addition write a comment on the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches will augment concurrent coding with multiple coders. They will also help
	when trying out new code concepts that may not require a merge or commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	The diagrams give a graphic representation of the structure and order of the 
	version control of a project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The branch is merged into the main phase of a coding project and becomes the new 
	head (apparently). 

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Manual merges will allow the coder or project lead to choose and merge in the 
	optimal code changes to the Main flow of the project. This may be optimized if 
	all contributing coders give input as the merge is processed.
